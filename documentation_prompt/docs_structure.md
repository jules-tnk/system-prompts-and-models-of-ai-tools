## File Naming Conventions

### General Rules

- Use lowercase letters only
- Separate words with hyphens (`-`)
- Use descriptive, implementation-focused names
- Include version numbers when applicable (e.g., `v2-api-specification.md`)

### Prefixes for Organization

- `req-` for requirement documents (e.g., `req-functional.md`)
- `spec-` for technical specifications (e.g., `spec-api-endpoints.md`)
- `arch-` for architecture documents (e.g., `arch-system-overview.md`)
- `test-` for testing documents (e.g., `test-integration-cases.md`)
- `deploy-` for deployment documents (e.g., `deploy-production-guide.md`)

### File Extensions

- `.md` for Markdown documentation files
- `.yaml` or `.yml` for API specifications and configuration
- `.mmd` for mermaidjs diagrams
- `.plantuml` for plantuml diagrams
- `.json` for configuration templates

### Diagrams and Visual Elements

- **Diagrams**: Create all diagrams using Mermaid JS or PlantUML syntax embedded within Markdown files
- **User Choice**: Ask the user whether they prefer Mermaid JS or PlantUML for diagram creation
- **Integration**: All diagrams should be embedded directly in the relevant Markdown files using code blocks
- **Types**: System architecture, data flow, component relationships, deployment diagrams, etc.

> **Important**: All diagram text content must be simple and concise. Use only plain text with no emojis, special characters, or decorative elements. Keep labels, node names, and descriptions brief and professional.

## Core Documentation Files

### Root Level Files

#### README.md

- **Purpose**: Project overview and quick navigation
- **Content**: Project description, key features, architecture summary, getting started guide
- **Target Audience**: All stakeholders and AI agents

#### PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md

- **Purpose**: Comprehensive project vision and scope
- **Content**: Business objectives, success criteria, project timeline, stakeholder information
- **Target Audience**: Project managers, stakeholders, development teams

#### GLOSSARY.md

- **Purpose**: Centralized definition of terms and concepts
- **Content**: Technical terms, business terminology, acronyms, domain-specific language
- **Target Audience**: All team members and AI agents

## Folder-Specific Guidelines

### Requirements Folder (`/requirements/`)

Contains all business and technical requirements that drive the implementation.

**Files:**

- `functional-requirements.md`: What the system must do, user stories, business logic, acceptance criteria
- `non-functional-requirements.md`: Performance, security, scalability, compliance requirements, constraints

### Use Cases Folder (`/use-cases/`)

Contains visual use case diagrams organized by user types, with each use case represented as a separate diagram file.

**Structure:**

- **Subfolders by User Type**: Create subfolders based on the specific user types for your application
- **One Diagram per Use Case**: Each use case gets its own diagram file (.mmd or .plantuml)
- **User-Centric Organization**: Group use cases by the type of user who performs them

**File Naming:**

- Use descriptive names for each use case: `user-registration.mmd`, `password-reset.mmd`
- Focus on the action or workflow: `create-project.mmd`, `export-data.mmd`
- Include error scenarios: `failed-login.mmd`, `payment-declined.mmd`

**Diagram Content:**

- **Actors**: Clearly identify the user type and any external systems
- **Flow Steps**: Step-by-step process from start to completion
- **Decision Points**: Branch points and alternative paths
- **Error Handling**: What happens when things go wrong
- **Success Outcomes**: End state of successful use case completion

> **Important**: All diagram text must be simple and concise. Use only plain text with no emojis, special characters, or decorative elements. Keep all labels, node names, and descriptions brief and professional.

### Architecture Folder (`/architecture/`)

Defines the overall system design and technical approach.

**Files:**

- `system-architecture.md`: High-level system design, component relationships, data flow (includes embedded diagrams)
- `technology-stack.md`: Technologies, frameworks, tools, dependencies, and technical decisions

### API Folder (`/api/`)

Complete API design and documentation for all endpoints.

**Files:**

Comprehensive testing strategy and specifications.

**Files:**

- `test-strategy.md`: Testing approach, methodology, coverage requirements, testing types
- `test-cases.md`: Detailed test scenarios, functional tests, API tests, UI tests, edge cases

## Content Quality Standards

### Specification Completeness

Each file must include:

- Clear purpose and scope
- Detailed implementation requirements
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Acceptance criteria
- Examples and code snippets where applicable

### Technical Accuracy

- All technical specifications must be implementable
- Version numbers for all dependencies
- Complete configuration examples
- Error handling and edge case coverage

### AI Agent Optimization

- Structured format for easy parsing
- Unambiguous technical language
- Complete context for each specification
- Clear relationships between components

## Version Control and Updates

### Versioning Strategy

- Use semantic versioning for specification updates
- Maintain changelog for significant changes
- Tag major specification releases
- Track dependencies between specification versions

### Change Management

- Document all specification changes
- Impact analysis for modifications
- Approval process for architectural changes
- Communication plan for updates

## Implementation Guidance

### Development Sequence

The folder structure supports a logical development sequence:

1. **Requirements Phase**: Complete both files in `/requirements/`
2. **Use Cases Phase**: Create visual use case diagrams for all user types in `/use-cases/`
3. **Architecture Phase**: Design system architecture and technology stack in `/architecture/`
4. **Database Design**: Specify data layer in `/database/`
5. **API Design**: Define interfaces in `/api/`
6. **Frontend/Backend Design**: Detail implementation in respective folders
7. **Security Planning**: Specify security requirements and authentication in `/security/`
8. **Testing Strategy**: Plan quality assurance in `/testing/`
9. **Deployment Planning**: Prepare infrastructure in `/deployment/`

### Cross-References

Maintain clear links between related specifications:

- Requirements → Use Cases → Architecture → Implementation specifications
- Use Case diagrams → API specifications → Database schemas → Frontend/Backend components
- Security requirements → Authentication → Implementation specifications
- Testing requirements → Use Cases → All functional specifications

### Key Benefits of Simplified Structure

- **Focused Content**: Each folder contains maximum 2 files, ensuring concentrated and comprehensive specifications
- **Visual Use Cases**: Dedicated use case diagrams organized by user types for clear workflow understanding
- **Clear Separation**: Distinct separation between different aspects of the project
- **Embedded Diagrams**: All diagrams integrated within relevant Markdown files or as standalone diagram files for use cases
- **Implementation Ready**: Streamlined structure optimized for AI agent consumption and software development

This simplified structure ensures that AI agents have complete, organized, and implementable specifications for building software projects successfully while maintaining clarity and avoiding information fragmentation.
